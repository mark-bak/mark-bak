# Hello there 
I write some code sometimes when I am bored.

## Projects:

### BiKinematics - MTB suspension analysis.
- Python Kivy/Numpy/Scipy/Matplotlib (&maybe some faster compiled languages in future when I feel the need to learn)
- Analyse leverage ratio, axle path, anti squat of common mtb suspension systems.
- Easily import images for reference and impose relevant geo.
- Reasonably nice GUI interface :).
- Future work -> Support for more suspension systems (6-bar family, linear dof ones). Results validation. Braking characteristics (anti-rise), Prettifying and adding icons :).
- Wrote this to learn Python/OO languages/how to actually code & manage a decent size project.

### BiKinematicsJS - MTB suspension analysis - in browser!!!.
- React SPA implementation of BiKinematics GUI - aiming for (semi) live updating graphs -> might need to optimise solver fcns a fair bit :)
- Python Flask backend serving the linkage solver fcns
- Eventually deploy to web at some point when it works reasonably well
- Hopefully also add some bike database functionality thing


### ProjectOne - Private.
- Python/~~Flask~~Quart/Numpy/Pandas | React | SQLite.
- Project for acquiring, managing, analysing and acting on web-based data/streams.
- Writing to learn web stuff (HTTP,websockets,javascript,APIs,authentication) & large data management (databases etc.).

### Future projects.
- Some Arduino based physical projects likely to come when I have the resources...
- Maybe some machine learning since everyone and their dog is doing it...
