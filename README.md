# Hello there 
I write some code sometimes when I am bored.

## Projects:

### BiKinematics - MTB suspension analysis.
- Python Kivy/Numpy/Scipy/Matplotlib (&maybe some faster compiled languages in future when I feel the need to learn)
- Analyse leverage ratio, axle path, anti squat of common mtb suspension systems.
- Easily import images for reference and impose relevant geo.
- Reasonably nice GUI interface :).
- Future work -> Support for more suspension systems (6-bar family, linear dof ones). Results validation. Braking characteristics (anti-rise), Prettifying and adding icons :).
- Wrote this to learn Python/try to actually code & manage a decent size project.

### BiKinematicsJS - MTB suspension analysis - in browser!!!.
- React SPA implementation of BiKinematics GUI - aiming for live updating graphs -> might need to optimise solver fcns a fair bit :)
- Python Flask backend serving the linkage solver fcns
- Massive WIP deployed at http://bikinematics.herokuapp.com/
- Hopefully also add some bike database functionality thing

### bikinematicssolver
- pypi pacakge with the solver fcns for above

### Future projects.
- Some Arduino based physical projects likely to come when I have the resources...
- Maybe some machine learning since everyone and their dog is doing it...
